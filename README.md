# mini-project
Our goal is to predict whether one character will die or not using some possible variables.
We found the dataset on Kaggle.
We use Muti-variable Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, Light GBM and Grid Search in out project.
The workflow of our project is Data Visualisation and Analysis -> Cleaning Dataset -> Machine Learning and Comparison of Different ML Models.
